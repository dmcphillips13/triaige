Last updated: 2026-03-09

## Current status

**Phase:** Core pipeline complete through Step 18. Final week — Postgres persistence, repo management UX, setup CLI, then polish.

### Completed
- [x] Project planning and scoping
- [x] Architecture decisions locked (see AGENTS.md §2)
- [x] API contract defined (see AGENTS.md §5)
- [x] AGENTS.md rewritten for Demo Day scope
- [x] PROJECT_CONTEXT.md created
- [x] Step 1: Runner scaffold (pyproject.toml, FastAPI stubs, settings, schemas)
- [x] Step 2: Sample app + Playwright suite (separate repo)
- [x] Step 3: Triage memory corpus (~30 docs)
- [x] Step 4: Qdrant Cloud provisioning + indexing pipeline + dense retriever
- [x] Step 5: GitHub API tool (read PR context)
- [x] Step 6: LangGraph agentic workflow wired to /ask
- [x] Step 7: Playwright result ingestion + /triage-run endpoint with persistence
- [x] Step 8: Dashboard triage UI — display triage runs, detail view, approve/reject
- [x] Step 9: Programmatic image diff (Pillow pixel comparison, region detection, overlay)
- [x] Step 10: GPT-4o vision analysis (multi-modal screenshot analysis node)
- [x] Step 11: Batch triage with failure grouping by component + pattern
- [x] Step 12: Screenshot comparison viewer (side-by-side, swipe slider, diff overlay)
- [x] Step 13: Human-in-the-loop + episodic memory (approve/reject → Qdrant episodes → few-shot retrieval)
- [x] Step 14: GitHub automated actions — PR-labeled runs + "Update Baselines" PR for approved expected failures via Git Data API
- [x] Step 15: Deploy runner to Render + dashboard to Vercel
- [x] Step 16: GitHub App OAuth + repo linking (sign-in flow, per-repo access control, token forwarding, link a repo UI)
- [x] Step 17: GitHub Actions workflow (merged PR in sample app → Playwright → POST /triage-run)
- [x] Step 18: Triage mode settings + submission actions — pre-merge/post-merge checkboxes, PR comment posting, "Submit Changes" (approved → baseline update PR, rejected → GitHub issue with bug report), submission results persisted in localStorage, open/closed run tabs with close run button, pre-merge runs are read-only

### Up next (final week — all items are must-haves)
- [x] Step 19: Runner-side Postgres persistence — Neon free tier, asyncpg, 5 tables (runs, failure_results, verdicts, submissions, repo_settings), swap dashboard from localStorage to API
- [x] Step 20: Runs page redesign — Main/PR/Closed tabs; known failure annotations; submission-aware action gating
    - **Main tab** (default): post-merge runs on main branch, fully actionable (approve/reject, submit changes, close)
    - **PR tab**: pre-merge runs from open PRs, informational only (read-only, no actions)
    - **Closed tab**: runs manually closed by reviewer (read-only archive)
    - **Known failure annotations** (both Main and PR tabs): if a test has been failing since a previous merged run, show "Failing since PR #X: title" with a link to the PR that introduced the regression
    - **Open submission links**: if an open baseline PR or GitHub issue exists for a failing test, show the link on the failure card; also include these links in the PR comment posted for pre-merge runs
    - **Action gating on Main tab**: if a failure already has an open PR or issue, hide approve/reject buttons (prevents duplicate submissions); if it's a known failure with no open submission, allow approve/reject normally
- [x] Step 20.1: Net-new failure filtering — only show failures not present in previous open post-merge runs; skip run creation when zero new failures; post-merge runs auto-close when all failures have submissions; pre-merge runs auto-close when superseded or when the PR merges; default both triage modes enabled
- [ ] Step 21: Actionable pre-merge workflow with merge gate — pre-merge becomes the primary workspace; approved baselines commit directly to PR branch; unexpected changes file issues; GitHub check gates merge until all net-new failures addressed; pre-existing failures (failing on main with open issue) shown but not actionable; Main tab becomes health dashboard showing open issues on failing tests; post-merge runs are diagnostic only
- [ ] Step 22: Repos landing page + add repo flow — repos page with cards, "Connect Repo" flow via GitHub App
- [ ] Step 23: Issue attribution agent — async agent scans merge history, adds attribution comments to issues
- [ ] Step 24: Auto-approve baselines above confidence threshold (stretch)
- [ ] Step 25: Settings UI — per-repo config page for API keys, triage mode toggles, merge gate toggle
- [ ] Step 26: Repo setup CLI — `npx triaige init` to scaffold workflow, config, and secrets
- [ ] Step 27: Procedural memory — self-improving triage instructions via reflection (stretch)
- [ ] Step 28: Component ownership lookup (stretch)
- [ ] Step 29: RAGAS evaluation (stretch)
- [ ] Step 30: Polish + Loom

## Key decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| LLM (text) | GPT-4o-mini | Cheapest capable model; best LangChain integration |
| LLM (vision) | GPT-4o | Vision capabilities for screenshot diff analysis |
| Embeddings | text-embedding-3-small (1536d) | Pairs with OpenAI; one API key |
| Vector DB | Qdrant Cloud (free tier) | Production-ready, metadata filtering, hybrid search |
| Orchestration | LangGraph | Agentic state machine with conditional routing |
| Runner deploy | Render (free tier) | Better Python support than Vercel |
| Dashboard deploy | Vercel | Already scaffolded; natural fit for Next.js |
| External tool | GitHub API (primary) | Read PR context for classification; create PRs/issues for actions |
| Image analysis | GPT-4o vision + Pillow pixel diff | Qualitative + quantitative screenshot comparison |
| Sample app | Separate repo, 3–5 page dashboard | Realistic visual regressions for demo |
| Corpus | LLM-generated synthetic triage memory | ~30 docs: cases, runbooks, known changes |
| Observability | LangSmith | Traces all agent runs automatically via LangGraph |
| UI theme | Light theme, stoplight colors, black text | Red=unexpected, yellow=uncertain, green=expected |
| CI trigger | GitHub Actions | Merged PR → Playwright → Triaige |
| Memory architecture | CoALA framework (AIE9) | Semantic + episodic (core), procedural (stretch) |
| Feedback loop | Episodic memory in Qdrant | Approved decisions become few-shot examples for future classifications |
| Testing | Deferred to post-Demo Day | Focus dev time on features and polish |
| Demo format | Live end-to-end pipeline | Full product flow is the definition of demo-ready |
| Process | Step-by-step commits | Mirror Mismatch workflow (AGENTS.md §13) |

## Architecture reference

This project follows the same architecture as the **Mismatch** repo:
- Same stack: FastAPI + LangGraph + Qdrant Cloud + Next.js
- Same deployment: Render (backend) + Vercel (frontend)
- Same patterns: tools as pure data fetchers, deterministic formatting, graceful degradation
- Same process: step-by-step commits, one change at a time
